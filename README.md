# Scientific article using Quarto


This is my template for scientific articles. It is based on the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). 
Special features are:
- citation via DOI or bibtex
- GitHub action to render the article

# Get Started

Create a repo by clicking on using the template
Install Quarto

## Render the article

Then you can render the article with the following command:
```
quarto render
```
If you have problems to render the article, you can try to render it to html or docx only
```
quarto render --to html
quarto render --to docx
```

## Formating:

The script `writing/line_breaker.py writing/*qmd`
formats the text so that

-  each sentence is on a new line
-  sentences are broken acording to [semantic line breaks](https://sembr.org/).

Check always what he does with diff views e.g. in VS code.

In order to not break after abbreviations like `Fig.Â `
use [special spaces](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tpcg.php?p=1VgtlFdW) (mostly Alt+Space) to distinguish them.

## Clean
remove all files ignored in gitignore to clean the directory
```
git clean -x --dry-run writing/
git clean -x -f writing/
```

## Continuous integration
Github action can render the files as test.
If the action run, you can [see the pdf](https://github.com/silask/quarto_article/blob/gh-pages/manuscript.pdf)

Adapt this to `https://github.com/<user>/<reponame>/blob/gh-pages/manuscript.pdf` for your repo.

DocX and html are also available at [`https://github.com/<user>/<reponame>/blob/gh-pages/`](https://github.com/silask/quarto_article/blob/gh-pages/)

Obviously only if you have access to the repository.
