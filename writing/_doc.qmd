::: {.callout-note}
This is a small section with some recommendation
and examples.

## citations {#sec-citations}
Cite doi or name in bibtex.
you can export them from Mendeley
or Zotero to resources/bibliography.bib

[@MacFarlane_2023 ; @doi:10.21105%2Fjoss.00027].


@MacFarlane_2023 says something about the subject.
(makes sense only with author name style)



## Cross References

## Figures
During drafting I suggest top put many panels in a [multi figure](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#cross-references).

Figures should be saved in figures/
and should be ideally in svg format. Png works too but less for pdf conversion.
svg can directly be compiled to pdf https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3/pdf.html


::: {#fig-example layout-ncol=2}


![legend for sub figure 1](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/logo.png){#fig-logo width=50%}

![legend for sub figure 2](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/culmen_depth.png){#fig-culmen width=50%}


Finally all the text would be in a single caption
but during the drafting it is easier to have it in each sub figure.
The space after this line is very important!!

Apparently multi-panel figures are not working properly in docx (who would have thought) It worked before using quarto 1.3.0 and will work again in 1.7

:::

Ref whole figure with @fig-example
Ref panel with @fig-culmen

The advantage is that if we change panels e.g.
man figure/ supplementary figure the numbering will be updated automatically.
