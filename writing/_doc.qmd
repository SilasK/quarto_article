@MacFarlane_2023 says something about the subject.

## Figures
During drafting I suggest top put many panels in a multi figure.

Figures should be saved in figures/
and should be in svg format.
svg can directly be compiled to pdf https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3/pdf.html


::: {#fig-example layout-ncol=2}


![legend for sub figure 1](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/logo.png){#fig-logo width=50%}

![](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/culmen_depth.png){#fig-culmen width=50%}



Finally all the text would be in a single caption
but during the drafting it is easier to have it in each sub figure.
The space after this line is very important!!

:::



Ref whole figure with @fig-example
Ref panel with @fig-culmen

The advantage is that if we change panels e.g.
man figure/ supplementary figure the numbering will be updated automatically.
