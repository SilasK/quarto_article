## Figures
During drafting I suggest top put many panels in a multi figure.

Figures shoiuld be saved in figures/ and should be in svg format.
svg can directly be compiled to pdf https://quarto.org/docs/prerelease/1.3/pdf.html


::: {#fig-example layout-ncol=2}


![legend for subfigure 1](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/logo.png){#fig-logo width=50%}

![](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/culmen_depth.png){#fig-culmen width=50%}



Finally all thext would be in a single caption but during the drafting it is easier to have it in each subfigure.
The space after this line is very important!!

:::



Ref whole figure with @fig-example
Ref panel with @fig-culmen

The advantage is that if we change pannels e.g. man figure/ suplementary figure the numbering will be updated automatically.

## Writing guidelines:
1. Use as many empty lines as necessary.
1. new line after each sentence, to make your live with Git easier. 
   - Don't break after abreviations like `Fig.Â `. Use [special spaces](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_markdown_editor.php) to distinguish them.
2. Advanced: use [semantic line breaks](https://sembr.org/).
